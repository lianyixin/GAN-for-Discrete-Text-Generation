# GAN-for-Sequence-Generation
My personal learning for sequence generation using GAN

## Why sequence generation
Q&A, 

## The way for sequence generation
### MLE
Drawbacks: exposure bias and label bias.
### Naive RL
Drawbacks: biased and correlate poorly with human judgments. less of semeantic properties.
### GAN
An approach for estimating intractable probabilities.

## SeqGAN, an impactful way for discrete sequence generation
Generally, GAN is applied for continuous problem like image generation. For discrete sequence generation, the gradient cannot transferred to the generator. SeqGAN innovatively incorporated RL into the update of generator gradient using Monte Carlo policy gradient estimation. 

However, after several
